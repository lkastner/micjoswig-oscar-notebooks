# The tropical Grassmanniann TGr$(3,6)$

The Grassmannian Gr$(k,n)$ is an algebraic variety which parametrizes the $k$-dimensional linear subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space, say over the complex numbers.
The tropical Grassmannian TGr$(k,n)$ is its tropicalization, and it parametrizes the realizable tropical linear spaces.

The investigation of the tropical Grassmannians started with [an article](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/advg.2004.023/pdf) by Speyer and Sturmfels.
Here we recover some of their results.
