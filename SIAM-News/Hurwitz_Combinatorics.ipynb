    "## Theoretical Background \n",
    "\n",
    "Enumerative algebraic geometry is a subfield of algebraic geometry concerned with counting invariants. Enumerative problems include the classical problem of counting how many curves of degree $d$ pass through a collection of points in some space or algebraic variety. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Counting maps of Riemann surfaces: Hurwitz numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will count meromorphic maps of compact complex manifolds of dimension 1, called _Riemann Surfaces_ to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$, $f:X\\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}^1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We fix the genus $g$ of $X$ and the degree $d$ of $f$. For this notebook, we will consider Riemann surfaces of genus 1 and maps of degree 3, in our paper  <font color=blue>[AMNSSS]</font> we further cover the case of genus 3 and degree 4. Maps of Riemann surfaces have a special structure: Outside of a finite set of points (in our case six) called _branch points_, maps of Riemann surfaces are (topological) covers of degree $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, outside of the branch points, every point has exactly $d$ preimages, whereas the branch points have less preimages. Since the maps we are considering are meromorphic maps of complex manifolds, locally they can be described as $f=z^k$ around the preimages of points on $\\mathbb{P}^1$. Now, we impose constraints on the $k$ in the local representation: In our concrete problem, we fix the branch points $x_1,\\dots,x_6$ and we require the map to have _simple ramification_ over all $x_i$, i.e. every $x_i$ has two preimages $y_i$ and $w_i$, and the local expression of the holomorphic map is given by $f = z^2$ around one of them, and by $f = z$ around the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monodromy representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Monodromy representations allow us to view the geometric situation described above in a group-theoretic and combinatorial light: The behaviour of the cover around the preimage branch points can be described in terms of permutations by investigating preimages of loops around branch points, associating a transposition to each loop. For details, see <font color=blue>[CM]</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicitely, a monodromy representation of degree $d$ is a list of permutations $(\\tau_1, \\dots, \\tau_i)$ in $\\mathbb{S}_d$ such that the $\\tau_i$ act transitively on $(1,\\dots,d)$ and $\\tau_d\\circ\\cdots\\circ \\tau_1 = id$, and monodromy representations are in 1-1 correspondence with covers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we implemented utility in OSCAR <font color=blue>[Oscar]</font> for constructing and analyzing monodromy representations. For instance, we can check whether a given vector of permutations acts transitively on $(1,2,3)$:"
